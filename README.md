    * Can replace wild Chainsaws

    * Weighs 25 blocks
    * Fire to swing it
    * Altfire to lunge and swing
    * hold Firemode and press Fire to throw it
    * Decently effective at gibbing dead monsters, for it's weight
    * Loadout code: CLV
    * Class: HDCleaver

    "We heard that some carry a cleaver around exclusively to chop dead monsters into bits.
    Of course, we can't just let our mercs go and buy one from other companies! What if they're cheap and break
    after just a couple of uses?
    This is why we started production of this very unremarkable, but sturdy butcher knife!
    Made out of high quality steel it may not be very fancy, but it can dish out a surprising amount of hurt
    and is very unlikely to break when hitting a Hell knight's thick skull! Watch you fingers!"
